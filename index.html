                    <h2>Amsterdam</h2>
                    <p>Amsterdam. That is often one of the first things I hear when I tell someone that I live in The Netherlands. Often accompanied with assuming that that is where I live (nope!). True, it's a magnificant city. But The Netherlands is so much more than that.</p>
                    <p>Did you know about the <a id="aekLink">(micro) deserts</a> that can be found on a few rare locations in The Netherlands? Or have you heard about the old stone graves that were build during the same time as the pyramids and Stonehenge? </p>
                    <p>On this page I'll show some of the "hidden" gems that may or may not be known so much outside of The Netherlands. And adding a bit of fun facts here and there. Stay tuned for more!</p>
