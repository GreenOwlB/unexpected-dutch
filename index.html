                    <h2>Amsterdam</h2>
                    <p>Amsterdam. That is often one of the first things I hear when I say I live in The Netherlands. Often accompanied with assuming that that is where I live (nope!). True, it's a magnificant city, known by many. But The Netherlands is so much more than that.</p>
                    <p>Did you know about the (micro) deserts that can be found on a few rare locations in The Netherlands? Or the old stone graves that were build during the same time as the pyramids and Stonehenge? </p>
                    <p>On this page I'll try to show some of the "hidden" gems that may not be known so much outside of The Netherlands.</p>
